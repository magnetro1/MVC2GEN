# About

Code base for MvC2-video making process that uses RAM values from the game to drive animations. The goal is to automate the data processing and have Adobe After Effects generate custom heads-up-display animations.

## Status

The current process is self-contained in the 'resources/After Effects Projects+' folder. The file LoadMe.aep contains all the Expressions that run the data processing logic to drive animations within After Effects. A test-clip directory containing JS data for AE is located in 'TestClip&Data/CaptainCommandoRogueCable8_ae'.
