## Ideas 💡

* Post-Death, make it look like the dummy is supposed to come out from the right side of the screen, when they come out from the left.
* Ruby, Tron, Rogue-AA, Chain, Trip, Barrel, DHC, Auto-Assist again 1F on DC?
* Pause On Sentinel unblockable
  
## OK ✅

* Combo after throw with Spiral
* Juggernaut HP-Punch > Headcrush V2
* Magneto: QCF+PP, Spider-Man: QCF+PP / Chun-Li: QCF+KK, X: DHC
* MSP vs Servbot * 3 to no-damage the 3 different supers
* Psylocke + Ruby-Y: HP SJGC
* Psylocke vs Marrow & War Machine (and Sonson?) no-damage
* Sentinel assist 1  bug w/ Venom Rush switch side stuff vs Jin
* Tag causes Dizzy/Spin-Out > Punish!
* Triple FSD-B Setup: Magneto, Wolverine, Bison VS Roll + Amingo
  
## NG ❌

* THC Unblockable Escape using Just-Defend and THC
* Magneto, Low-Health-Dummy vs. Cyclops, Juggernaut-Puch: HK-Forcefield + Dummy vs. Cyclops calls Juggernaut-Punch (hits Magneto and Dummy), LP-Optic Blast, 5~ hits, Magneto cancels into Tempest, adds another 5~ hits -- with Juggernaut Punch, the Dummy should be dead? Magneto, DHC, Dummy
* Sentinel corner mekuri vs Capcom or Jin, spawn drones underneath them
* Jill Zombie with Fire OTG as NoCount
* Samurai s.HP , c.LP s.HP infinite
* Blackheart-B THC Unblockable on Incoming and maybe with other characters like Thanos/Jin?
* Cable HK-Long-Hold Grenade > FSD with something > Grenade puts them back into standing? or knockdown into grenade that puts them into standing, FSD mid-screen?
* Venom FSD normalization vs Roll
* Colossus QCF+LP, FSD, DHC-Wolverine-QCF+PP, DHC-Strider-QCF+PP, Grab, FSD, DHC, TAG, Special-Grab FSD again
* Servbot-B QCF+PP, Sentinel QCF+PP, Dummy Hits Servbots to go back down
* VS-Capcom j.infinite: Strider Psylocke, Chun-Li, Guile, Charlie  > FSD & Assist Followup: Guile, Charlie, Ken ( FSD > Assist > OTG )
* Bison Delay Kneepress from across a screen
  * Isn't OTG
  * Slow to come out, no FSD followups
  * Can hit after snap > dhc
* Combo Meter bug using 1f air stun. ex spiral level3 grab, dhc
* Anakaris & Doom instant land go under-dummy
* No-Count OTG with Hayato Dash-HP
* Strider Double-Bomb using Counter-Bug
  * HK bomb, interrupt, counter, counter back into bird, interrupt, hk or LK bomb
  * Flip Side with 2nd Bomb?
* Block Meter that allows movement only as well as quick-land to block something, quick land with doom or anak?
