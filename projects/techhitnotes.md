# Start Tech Hit

- If the throw does its damage before the tech window opens, the opponent will take damage, and then tech hit if they are alive.
- During Tech State, the character is invincible up until the state switches back to Normal Jump.

# Recovery Tech Hit

- Tech hit goes directly into Stand-Rise.
- Stand-Rise can be hit by meaty.
- Stand-Rise can go into Jumping (avoiding lows).

# Additional Notes

- First-Frame-OTGs will **beat** tech hit (good for Magneto, Sentinel, Iron Man).
- Only throws that cause hard knockdown stun can be teched at the end; otherwise, it is not possible to get the end-tech hit.
- Some characters' throws' tech hit window begins on the first frame of Throwing.
  - The opponent has 3 frames to tech.
  - Tech animation occurs:
    - 14F (Wolverine)
    - Tron Tech Hit animation occurs on frame 20.
  - For these characters, the window is on Frame 0.
  - If the Frame Skip Cycle is at 1 or 2, Tron's throw will occur instead of the enemy's, but the enemy's tech hit will occur automatically.
  - If the Frame Skip Cycle is at 3 or 4, the enemy's throw will occur instead.
