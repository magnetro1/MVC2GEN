# MSP Anathema Notes

## Double Snapback Setups

- **Basic from Psy/Solo**
  - 🌟 Range of attacks, e.g., `cr.lp > cr.LK`
  - ❓ `cr.mp` & `s.hk` knock-up amount

- **If Psy Hits:**
  - Certain situations & dummy combinations allow `S.LP => Snapback`
  - 🌟 Favor the point character with the unrollable `CR.LK`
  - `CR.HK` has to be done quicker unless the character combination is special
  - `CR.LK, CR.HK, SJ, LK, ADD, DLK, MK Snapback`

- **Dummies at different heights from Psylocke AAA hit**
  - 🌟 Sentinel weighs more than others
    - ✅ Double Snapback after Sentinel + Capcom pressure
  - Storm has a bigger air-hitbox
    - Show with Sentinel & Capcom & Psy or Mag
  - Magneto
    - Smaller than Storm
    - Show with Psylocke and ✅ Sentinel
  - Cable
    - Stuff misses on him due to his hitbox
    - Show with Sentinel
    - Show With Capcom
  - Capcom’s hitbox is really big
    - ✅ Show with Storm
    - ✅ Show with Sentinel

- **Dummies in different states (otg/standing)**
  - ✅ Pushback when attacking > 1 characters
  - ✅ This mechanic curtails possibilities

- **Bypassing Sentinel's Super Armor**
  - Hitstop vs non-Sentinel characters can keep them suspended

## Regular Snapback Setups

- **🏁 Sentinel RP Whiff**
  - If Sentinel doesn’t retract his HP-RP

- **Stray Psylocke hit**
  - React options with pick-up LP or unrollable LK

## Magneto Unblockable Setups/Loops

- **`CR.LK, CR.MK` Loop**
  - The MK/MP height can produce two different outcomes:
    - ✅ Sentinel bounces, NG
    - ✅ Sentinel lands on his feet, OK
  - Psy is a loop vs Sentinel
    - ✅ Can't mash
    - ✅ Can't call assists
    - ✅ Can't block db/df
    - ✅ Can be hit DB without switching directions

- **`CR.LK` vs Sentinel**
  - 🌟 Midscreen?
  - 🌟 Has to be meaty?

- **`CR.HP` vs Sentinel**
  - Probably don't include this (?)
  - Has to hit grounded Sentinel

- **`CR.HK` vs Sentinel(+)**
  - Instantly breaks armor
  - Rollable (backward roll-input, iirc)
  - Can work if Sentinel bounces or lands on his feet

- **Unblockable Normal + Psylocke => Tempest freeze**
  - From reset, call Psy, `2LK, Tempest` => Psy hits

- **LK-Forcefield**
  - Triggered by assist, follow-up hit can be unblockable

- **Shockwave**
  - With assists being hit, follow-up hits can be unblockable

- **Tempest/Shockwave DHC**
  - A projectile left on-screen before a 1f DHC

- **On-Incoming Sentinel, `S.HP/CR.HP` (?)**
  - Incoming state is its own thing
  - Can be avoided using a just-defend by the opponent

- **Hyper-Grav (?)**
  - Think of a setup

## Magneto Full-Screen Dash (GRD)

- **Show fwd-Dash startup**
  - 3f
- **Show bwd-Dash startup**
  - 1f
- **Turning around can be skipped**
  - On crossup, hold the intended dash direction before landing
  - `ff, bb || PP`
- **Special punishes by dashing**
  - `cr.HK/s.LK`

## Magneto HK-Throw Bug

- **Air combo reset**
- Requires Unfly or Magneto being tripped
- **One stock**
- **Two outcomes**
  - `QCB+Light` or `QCB+Heavy`

## Magneto Instant Overhead

- **VS Cable**
  - `SJ DLK` => ROM DHC to kill
- **VS Everyone except Sentinel**
  - Needs to be Psy, Jump, `DLK` (very hard on non-hitbox)

## Storm Instant Overhead

- **VS Cable**

## MSP 100% DHC & Unmashable Combos

- **Psylocke, instant overhead vs Cyclops/Cable**
  - Air combo to Tempest, to Hail Storm 100% with correct DHC timing
- **Show DHC damage scaling with Tempest**
  - Third wave of particles -> DHC to hail is the best?

## Magneto Air to Ground (?)

- **VS Sentinel**
- **VS Cable** (?)

## Magneto VS Jumps

- **GB Setups**
  - Square jump with LK recovers later than LP, so it’s better for GB?
- **TriJump/Jab to meaty vs U**
  - Specific timing required to stuff a jump-rise

## Magneto GBs

- **Inescapable `SJ.HP`**
  - Works if super-meaty
  - Slower than HK
  - Lasts longer than HK
  - Different vector if they take the hit

## Magneto Air Dash XX Tempest (D, DF+PP, F+KK)

- **Setup vs Sentinel** is different than setups vs regular characters
- **Setup vs Storm/Cable** can result in ROM or unrollable
- Wait for the hitstop of the previous attack to finish before doing the input

## Magneto ROM Optimal Route to 100%

- **`SJ.LK/LP, ADDF DLK, MK > more hits` (?)**
- For damage scaling, doing `LK MK, DLK MK` is better
- For wasting time, `LK, DLK MK` is better
- Dizzy results are about the same, but doing `LK, DLK MK` might fill dizzy faster.

## Magneto Hyper-Grav Tempest

- Best setup for optimal positioning to reduce chances of them mashing out
- Sentinel is not guaranteed to escape in the corner due to two-fold RNG
- **Sh/How LKK** - Hypergravs’ speeds and positioning.

## Magneto Air HP Throw into HGXXTempest

- Inescapable (if not teched) Air-HP throw, HG, Tempest

## Storm Hail Storm && Lightning Storm Mashing

- Show the in-game timer for mashing?
  - **Animation_Timer_Main: 32** => Counts down
- Hail Storm can be extended much more than Lightning Storm.
  - Due to frame skipping, it can only be mashed to +/- 1 or 2 hits?

## Magneto SJI

- **If VS Cable/IM**
- SJI out with Tempest or SJ-Tag
- Near the end of the round when GBs have a higher chance of happening
- Calling him as an assist will nullify the effect

## Magneto SJ With Block Meter

- Magneto can TriJump faster after being pushblocked
- **P1 Mag vs Cable/etc**
  - Pushblock a dash in `S.LP` or `CR.LK`, dash in, whiff-trijump `2LK`.
## Double Snapback Setups

- **Basic from Psy/Solo**
  - [ ] Range of attacks, e.g., `cr.lp > cr.LK`
  - [ ] `cr.mp` & `s.hk` knock-up amount

  - [x] Favor the point character with the unrollable `CR.LK`
  - [ ] `CR.HK` has to be done quicker unless the character combination is special
  - [ ] `CR.LK, CR.HK, SJ, LK, ADD, DLK, MK Snapback`
