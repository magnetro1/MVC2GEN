## Ideas 💡

* Bison Delay Kneepress from across a screen
  * Isn't OTG
  * Slow to come out, no FSD followups
  * Can hit after snap > dhc
* Combo Meter bug using 1f air stun. ex spiral level3 grab, dhc
* Anakaris & Doom instant land go under-dummy
* Sentinel corner mekuri vs Capcom or Jin, spawn drones underneath them
* Jill Zombie with Fire OTG
* No-Count OTG with Hayato Dash-HP
* Strider Double-Bomb using Counter-Bug
  * HK bomb, interrupt, counter, counter back into bird, interrupt, hk or LK bomb
  * Flip Side with 2nd Bomb?
* Magneto HK-Forcefield hitstop vs Colossus assist vs Point-Character who will be frozen anywhere (?)
* Cable FSI with 2HP, SJC vs Felicia Yarn into y_boost
* Samurai s.HP , c.LP s.HP infinite
* Block Meter that allows movement only as well as quick-land to block something, quick land with doom or anak?
* Ruby, Tron, RogueAA, Chain, Trip, Barrel, DHC, Auto-Assist again 1F on DC?

## OK ✅

* Triple FSD-B Setup: Magneto, Wolverine, Bison VS Roll + Amingo
* Combo after throw with Spiral
* Tag causes Dizzy/Spin-Out > Punish!
* Psylocke + Ruby-Y: HP SJGC
* Psylocke vs Marrow & War Machine (and Sonson?) no-damage

## NG ❌

* Blackheart-B THC Unblockable on Incoming and maybe with other characters like Thanos/Jin?
* Cable HK-Long-Hold Grenade > FSD with something > Grenade puts them back into standing? or knockdown into grenade that puts them into standing, FSD mid-screen?
* Venom FSD normalization vs Roll

## Idea Video 📽️

* Colossus Spin-Grab > FSD > No-Count DHC: Colossus, Wolverine, Strider, Grab, FSD, DHC, TAG, Special-Grab FSD again
* Servbot-B  Super, Sentinel plasma storm
* Shockwave > Crawler Assault / Chun-Li QCF+KK, DHC into standing
* Sentinel assist 1 bug w/ Venom Rush switch side stuff vs Jin

## In-Progress 🚧

## Edit 🎦

* VS-Sentinel Mekuri Infinites
* VS-Capcom j.infinite: Strider Psylocke, Chun-Li, Guile, Charlie  -> FSD & Assist Followup: Guile, Charlie, Ken ( FSD > Assist > OTG )
* Juggernaut HP-Punch > Headcrush V2

## Research 🔬

* Ken, Dan, Akuma, Charlie, Guile FSD -> THC spacing fix.
* THC Unblockable Escape using JD and THC

THC FSD: Wolverine/A
  
DHC FSD:
  Magneto & Spider-Man or Chun-Li & ___
