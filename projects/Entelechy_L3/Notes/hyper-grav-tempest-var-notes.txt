Turbo FrameSkip:
  A frame is skipped every four frames, so timers that are supposed to count down
  every frame, actually skip a number every third frame. So you'll see 10, 9, 8, 6, 5, 4, 2, 1, 0

P2: Dummy:
  Hitstop
  Inputs
  Throw_Counter_Mash value for Hyper-Grav
    Not affected by frame skip
    RNG. 12-20
    Direction+Input(s) reduce by 3
    Button(s) only reduce by 1
    Directions reduce by 2
    [Direction+Button, Neutral+DifferentButton] reduce by 4 over two frames
