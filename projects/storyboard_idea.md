# Tutorial

## Over-arching structure:
  * Start with the logo and its centerpiece, the layout of how to play, then move into the nodes.
  * The caption on the image is probably the fulcrum of at least the first point, underscoring its practicality.
  * Connect the nodes by leaving bits of information that relate.

## Video Structure(?)
  * Logo 
    * This is an mvc2 tutorial
  * "Introducing! 3ON3 TEAM BATTLE"
    * I'd say show footage that emblematic of the game to lauditory VO to pique interest
  * How to play/Oval in the center:
    * Easy to play hard to be good
    * Show an arcade joystick and super impose the PSD-layers onto it

## Content Note:
  * One route is to show famous matches that have demonstrated the node. EX: Soo v Justin during Evo2k2 for Snapback, Duc Pushblock into AHVB during Hyper Sentinel Force. This might be more of a production nightmare to get the permissions/setup the story
  * I can record any clips showing this, but since they are simple, maybe embelished editing ideas can make it more entertaining. Like intersplicing multiple clips as 'one combo'. Slicing the visual frame to show two combos at once. 


## Technical Notes 
#### Center, then top Left, Down, Right, Up based on the marquee image
0. Center-Oval Content:
    * Guard:
      * High/low/air
      * Chip exists
    * Retreating
      * any active attack on-screen ANYWHERE, causes preblock
      * walk speeds vary
      * jumping upback isn't always safe, but you can call assists
    * Jumping
      * Floaty jumps like Anakaris, Dhalsim, Sentinel
      * You dont go very far
    * Crouching
      * Shorter, avoids chip damage and hitboxes
      * Vulnerable to overheads
    * Approaching
      * Completely vulnerable
      * Walkspeeds vary so Cable will get hit before Sentinel
    * Dash: 
      * Moves you forward or back very quickly
      * Doesn't work if there is something on-screen to block
      * Can use PP
      * Wave Dashing as a technique
      * Dash > Normal Jump boosts you
      * good/bad examples: Magneto (apogee) vs Zangief/Juggernaut
    * Super Jump:
      * Best movement method in the game for a lot of characters
      * Can't call assists
      * You can move left/right: Show Colossus and Spiral
      * SJ UB/UF during pre-block moves you up significantly faster
      * Can't call assists
    * Buttons: https://youtu.be/FxyWuS5Ndnc?t=21
      * MP/MK exists only as double-tapping LP/LK
      * Not everyone can do a 6 hit chain combo (air/ground). Ex: Blackheart vs Strider/Psylocke
      * Assists are a huge part of the game
          * this feels dumb to say but it's quintessential because of the "3ON3 Team Battle thing"; they're so important, they are dedicated buttons
      * Throws HP/HK + Direction

01. Throw Escape
    * Tech hit notes from previous video.
    * Normal timing doesn't work on Tron. You have to Tech at Frame 1
    * Can't pre-tech while falling like you can with rolling
    * Can't tech hit if the enemy does an unrollable/1st frame OTG like Magneto HK throw in the corner.
    * You go into Normal Jump if you Tech Hit in the air. (leading to Guard Breaks)
02. Tech Roll
    * Same amount of time/distance for everyone
    * You don't need to input it quickly before landing -- technicall you can input it as soon as the attack hits you. Ex: Psylocke AA or Jugernaut Punch (assist), you can input the roll as soon as they hit hit you.
    * Escapes good gimmicks (Guile air HK throw, Jill & Spiral, Doom unblockable CR.HK and Captain Commando) and bad Magnetos OTG attempts
    * Magneto, Iron Man, and Strider-Doom sometimes want you to Roll into them.
03. Advancing Guard
    * Same amount of time for everyone.
    * You go into neutral
    * Auto block active
04. Hyper Cancel
    * Buffer system prevents cancels from working; difficult to explain.
    * something about "There's timing to doing these. If you do them too fast, they won't happen, if you do them too slow, they won't COMBO."
    * Special Example: you can Super Cancel Hyper-Grav from a Normal Jump if Magneto lands on the ground: Normal jump, Hyper-Grav, wait until he lands, Super Cancel tos save him
    * Examples:
      * Lightning Attack XX Lightning Storm
      * Hyper-Grav XX Tempest
      * Rocket Punch XX Hyper Sentinel Force
      * Cable HP HP HP HP xx Psimitar XX AHVB
05. Hyper Combo: https://youtu.be/FxyWuS5Ndnc?t=70
    * Being hit builds you meter.
      * Storm HP Throw
      * Hitting Cable's assists can give him AHVB meter; maybe talk about how good the previous Supers in the examples are (Lightning Storm/Hail Storm/Tempest/ Hyper Sentinel Force/ AHVB here?)
    * Damage scaling - start a combo with a Hyper Combo as soon as possible. Examples: Cable HK + Capcom > AHVB. Magneto Jump up LK MK + Psylocke > Tempest
    * Adds Impact-Freeze/Hitstop to the enemy, freezing them as soon as the Hyper Combo flash occurs, preventing their inputs from registering, and their character from moving, extending their hitstun (reason for Hyper-Grav XX Tempest combo working).
06. Aerial Launcher
    * Everyone has one; chase period is a small window of time.
    * They are 1 frame faster than the normal versions (good if Iron Man)
    * You cannot normal cancel them. Example: Psylocke DF+HP cannot be canceled into HK.
    * This technique is useful for assist kills when you get a Double-Snap
07. Snapback
    * Breaks Super, not Hyper Armor
    * Magneto as a character using this to destroy teams
    * Count as specials, but cannot be super canceled
    * Adds Impact-Freeze/Hitstop to the enemy, freezing them as soon as the Hyper Combo flash occurs, preventing their inputs from registering, and their character from moving, extending their hitstun (reason for Hyper-Grav XX Tempest combo working).
    * A2 Snapback glitch
    * After-death Snapback glitch
08. Delayed Hyper Combo (DHC): https://youtu.be/FxyWuS5Ndnc?t=112
    * Resets Damage Scaling -> Storm-Sentinel and/or Magneto Tempest hitting and you DHC into Hail Storm to cause the Tempest Rocks to unscale again
    * Lot of characters can get 100% combos with these. Duc's team setup
    * Going off the marquee image, maybe use Ryu or Ken for kick-super first, then Captain America Hyper Charging Star, Cyclops Mega Optic Blast?
09. Variable Combination (THC): https://youtu.be/FxyWuS5Ndnc?t=140
    * Allows loops if the character is alone, Blackheart, Sentinel, Sabretooth-Birdie assist
    * Do not cause Flying Screen. Shockwave becomes rollable, making him unsafe
    * They do not reset damage scaling, but damaging because of the sheer volume of hits.
10. Variable Counter: https://youtu.be/FxyWuS5Ndnc?t=158
    * Cable Psimitar XX AHVB
    * Countering right before a super finishes tends to be safe. Ex: Hail
    * Bad counter-in attacks like E.M. Disruptor can be made safe by immediately doing a Tempest, and then immediately DHC'ing
11. Variable Assist (A1/A2)
    * The assist comes out on button-release, not press.
    * Do not come out if you are in blockstun (ex: Hail/Proton Cannon)
    * If the enemy has gaps in their combo, the assist will come out.
    * Air OK means Flight or Unfly
    * There is a small window before you land where you can call assists. In general, assists come out 'easily' because there's a giant buffer of time for when you can call them in between states.
12. Assist Select (a/b/y)
    * Your assist selection can affect your character's Assist, THC   and Counter
    * infamous/good ones: Doom, Psy, Commando, Cyclops that teams get   built around them
    * Lifebar color based on assist choice
    * Switch Glitch here, or in the previous node?
13. Variable Attack (Tag)
    * Invincible as soon as you press the button (unlike assist-calling, it is press, not let go of the button)
    * Counted as specials, but cannot super cancel them
    * Your character's incoming attack is generally a buffed version of another one of their attacks.
    * Acute vs Obtuse angles can be important. Iron Man / Sentinel are good examples; can't punish an incoming Hail Storm by tagging in Iron Man.
    * Can be very good, and allows your character to recovery their red-life.
    * Can be very bad, but even worth the damage you take to save a character
    * Good for combos. Teams can do combos predicated on switching, Jin/Magneto, MSS, Tron-Wolverine
